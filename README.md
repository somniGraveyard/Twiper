DEAD PROJECT

Now there is no any reason to keep developing this program, as the program is targeted to be an 'free' alternative for paid Tweet cleaner services.

Source code is now archived, and no further changes will be made here.

 **Twiper** *(pronounce as T-wee-per)* is an on-your-own Tweet cleaner, without paying commercial services but in really manual way.

 This is a sequel project of [twitter-pwa-archive-cleaner](https://github.com/SDSkyKlouD/twitter-pwa-archive-cleaner).

 This project is in early development, so no detailed instructions have been prepared yet. Use with caution!
